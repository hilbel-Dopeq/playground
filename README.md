# OPENFORGE PLAYGROUND!
This is a monorepo playground for various trials, tests, and other projects that don't fit into our other applications or initiatives, but that might eventually turn into something cool, big, or otherwise awesome!

## RULES

1. This repo is only for team projects that will be worked on by *more than just you*.  If you have at least 2 people working together from the OPENFORGE community; then this is the right spot!

2. Make a new folder for your project

3. Make a README within that folder.

4. Make sure you use coding, linting, and testing standards in your projects.   We never give up process!

5. Have fun and learn lots!
